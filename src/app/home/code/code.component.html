          You've seen the paint &amp; wine classes, now it's time to get
          techy and learn web development basics over trendy cocktails.

        <h5>
          The first thing to know is <em>no prior programming experience is
          required!</em> We can say that because we have plenty of mentors on hand to
          help you through the tough parts, no matter what session you sign up for.

          are built for the web, from basic HTML structure to handling user interaction with
          JavaScript. <!--You will learn about version control and how to collaborate with
          other developers using <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank"><b>GitHub</b></a>.-->
          We like to think of the curriculum as the <i>essential front-end developer tool kit</i>.

          <a href="https://xkcd.com/323/" target="_blank"><b>Ballmer Peak</b></a>
          courtesy of custom crafted cocktails, it's to infinity and beyond in
          writing code and learning to mentor others.
